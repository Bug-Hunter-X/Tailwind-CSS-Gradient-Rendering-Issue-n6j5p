# Tailwind CSS Gradient Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS gradients: incorrect or distorted gradient rendering.  The problem might stem from conflicting CSS rules or browser-specific rendering quirks.

## Bug Report

The `bug.js` file contains a simple component using a Tailwind CSS gradient. In certain scenarios, this gradient may not render as expected, appearing distorted or entirely missing.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file offers potential solutions. These include:

* **Specificity Override:** Ensuring that the Tailwind CSS gradient rules have sufficient specificity to override any conflicting styles.
* **Vendor Prefixing:** Adding vendor prefixes for better browser compatibility.
* **Alternative Gradient Implementation:** Using a different method of implementing gradients, such as linear-gradient or radial-gradient within the `style` attribute or a separate CSS file.

This repository serves as a guide to troubleshoot and resolve similar issues. Remember to always check your browser's developer tools for any specific CSS conflicts or rendering errors.
