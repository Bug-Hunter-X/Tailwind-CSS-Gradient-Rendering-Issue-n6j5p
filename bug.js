```javascript
// in your component file
<div className="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  {/* content */}
</div>
```
This code uses Tailwind's gradient feature. However, if you encounter issues where the gradient doesn't display correctly or appears distorted, there might be a conflict with other CSS rules or a problem with the browser's rendering engine.
